## Data Pipeline
### 1. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**
- Removed duplicates  
- Formatted dates, text, and numeric values  
- Standardized categorical values (Gender, Account Type, etc.)

### 2. **Database Integration (SQL)**
- Imported the cleaned dataset into a **SQL relational database**
- Structured tables for Customers, Transactions, Loans, and Credit Cards
- Queried data for aggregation and insights

### 3. **Data Analysis (Python)**
- Connected SQL database to Python using `pandas` and `SQLAlchemy`
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Statistical summaries  
  - Correlation analysis  
  - Missing value detection  
- Generated **heatmaps and visual plots** for data relationships

### 4. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize:
  - Customer demographics  
  - Account summaries  
  - Loan and credit card performance  
  - Gender-based comparisons  
  - Yearly loan trends
